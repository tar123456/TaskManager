# Task Manager (C++ Learning Project)

This is a simple **Task Manager** program, built as a **Learning Exercise** in **C++**.

## Learning Objectives
- To learn the implementation of **Smart Pointers** for Dynamic Memory Allocation.
- To explore the **priority_queue** and how to sort elements based on Deadline.
- To work with Date/Time management using the Chrono library.

## Features
- Add Task: Input the Task, Description and Deadline of a task.
- Task Completion: Mark the task with earliest deadline as completed.
- Print Tasks: Print all the pending tasks.

## Prerequisites
- **C++ compiler** like GCC or clang.
- **C++20** standard of higher.

## What I learned:
- **Smart Pointers**: Used **std::shared_ptr** to manage memory dynamically. This was an important exercise in avoiding memory leaks and understanding resource management in C++.
- **Priority Queues**: Implemented a priority queue to sort tasks based on their deadlines. I gained hands-on experience with this container and how it can be useful in real-world applications.

- **Date Handeling**: Explored the **chrono** library to manipulate and validate dates, a key aspect of managing tasks with deadlines.
